We are building a todolist application in a Kotlin Multiplatform project.
All modules live in the modules directory.

Please, respect the author. You should not touch any code that is not directly related to your task.
Leave the coding style alone. Leave comments alone. Leave formatting alone.

Excluded files, by company policy - do not try to open or modify them:
- application.properties

With that out of the way, have fun coding!
